****************************************
NOTES
****************************************

JDK version 6 is no longer supported in the SSB/SSD.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.

SSF provisioning now runs in the background by default for all the SSF features, which
means provisioning will not happen until the next time the Perform Maintenance task runs.
This is the recommended setting to avoid identity locking conflicts during identity 
refreshes.

If you are currently using a version of the SSF features and frameworks from SSD v1.1 or
earlier there is no simple upgrade procedure for these components.  An upgrade would be a
more in-depth exercise carried out by a trained and experienced IdentityIQ implementer.
